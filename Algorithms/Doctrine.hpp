    it feels as if you find it yourself it doesn't have an as powerful impact than as if someone else tells you; I think I need a
        doctrine; I think it's one of those things that give you something to fall back on when in doubt; it's probably like a sort
        of religion (but religion likely deals with a different set of doubts, yet some overlap is likely; people could interpret that
        as the doctrines supporting each other, probably ?); it is likely one of those things that can help my confidence, help define
        who I am by specifying who / what I should be; it's the kind of thing that gives purpose, that biases decision-making when no
        particular decision seems to be needed
    as a doctrine, christian religion seems more passive than a political ideology; and yet, religion has those routines, those periodic
        behaviours / rituals (for some, it's a daily prayer, for others it's a weekly or bi-weekly meeting)
    (*?) I guess George's POV that this serves him as a framework for understanding something, also does justice to what a doctrine is for
