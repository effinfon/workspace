    determine which (?"symbols / glyphs"?) are needed for my activities
        // decision: lower and upper alpha, decimal numerics, spaces (*?), some delimiters (*?) [these really need to be special, so that I can finally use some
        // sensible set of delimiters and make clear restrictions on what is allowed as input and what not; I don't understand, "why use :: as a delimiter if you
        // might want to use that is a sentence or expression; this all seems historical and stupid; it impedes my freedom, crush it"], etc. (?)
        <e.g.> if I want to be able to write a full blown sentence as an identifier, I want to be able to (!), and have it be properly delimited
        <e.g.> use delimiters such as to be able to well-specify what the function / type / ?? of an entity is and for this to suffice to only look locally [especially
            // for parallelism; but there is one more thing: make it similar to a cellular automaton, to biological cells; make code be similar to those things (*!?)]
