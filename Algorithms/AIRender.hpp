/*
    a meaningful way in which simulation engines can be improved, as a technology, is to make them self-adaptive / autonomously learning,
         which implies a framework in which the renderer / simulation engine itself is self-programmable / trainable; this would basically end
         up being something such as: "code searcher", "model of general physics equations", "specialized AI fluid simulator", "specialized AI
         rigid / elastic body simulation", etc.
