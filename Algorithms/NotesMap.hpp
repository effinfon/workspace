/*
    some notes are unreliably classified by just a class, therefore a graph-based mechanism that utilizes ~ "coupling strength / ampliture / weight"
        would be much prefered; for one, it could determine what is linked to what, automatically (there is no need to check what classes are already
        available at the moment of writting the note); it could also be used to identify when a note doesn't really fit any class well, by having
        overall weak links (it might be due to its interdisciplinary nature, or might be in need of a new class to be defined); some notes might
        overall have weak AND few links, or none (this is a clearer indication of the need for a new class, because interdisciplinarity is also excluded)
