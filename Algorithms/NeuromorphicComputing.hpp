    (*?) neuromorphic computing -> ~ "hardware variant" (syntax ?); "(artificial) neural networks" -> ~ "software version" (semantic ?)
    (*?) digital computing only uses binary states / boolean "algebra" [well, A boolean algebra, not THE boolean algebra (!*?)]; there have been cases
        or discussion about multi-state digital computer hardware (*?); apparently there would be increased hardware complexity which wouldn't produce
        more computational capacity, but the rhetoric about "spiking neural trains" would suggest a different way of trying to effectively "increase
        the dimensionality complexity of (digital) circuits" [or just circuits in general, really; no more of that "digital vs analog" thing (*?)]; thus
        a few things could happen: higher memory density, different flow control structures, (*?) "possibility for more computation ~ non-deterministic computing"
        [what I am trying to say by this is: what if one could use a more than just a binary circuit to "compute multiple paths in a path search" ?; basically,
        it's not literally a non-deterministic circuit, but it's "more than the single determinism circuit of binary circuits" (*?!)]
        // besides the "single determinism -> multi-determinism" aspect, there might also be a higher energy efficiency
    (*?) different signals -> different neurotransmitters (and their combinations / mixtures ?)
        // (*!?) so, for one part of the discussion, there's this aspect, that biology uses different combinations of neurotransmitters in synaptic communication,
            but what are the effects of that ? how does one visualize "the information being transmitted" ? also, due to the way synapses and neurons are being
            studied, there also seems to be a ~ "perspective change" in the sense that "it doesn't feel like the information is being transferred from one place to
            another and processed upon, but instead that an effect is imposed, by way of neurotransmitters, on the transmission channels and neurons themselves, and
            this in effect is computation and generates / cues further computation"
        // [warning: this time (in the neuromorphic model), even the transmission wires can do computation, unlike our current digital designs where wires are mostly for
            the transmission abstraction, and for processing there would be controllers (*!?); it's like for our current technology, wires are just an abstraction for
            transmission and controllers are a separate abstraction for processing; even GPU memory which claims to `do processing closer to memory` does actually use
            wires at all to do so, but smaller controllers instead; the real problem here is whether the hardware can even do processing: wires are `static`, they can't
            move; it is here where I assume, through my perspective, that `neuronal wires` can do computation because they are dynamic; a more "obvious" level of dynamism
            which can do computation is that neurons can link and unlink dynamically, adaptively]
    (*?) to me it seems that switching from the "potential levels" implementation for "states" in digital circuits, to a "spiking timing" implementation, is what
        neuromorphic circuits could be (partially) about; my point is that it seems to be a mechanism for increasing the "dimensionality" of states (thus information
        density, be it in memory or in computing)
    (*?"") "the physical properties of something like sillicon make it hard to control the current between (artificial) neurons" (*?)[then whta are quantum dots ?]
        // (*?) either way, in relation to this, there is usually some mention in textbooks which discuss this theme, that "due to fabrication differences of the
            components, digital circuits can still behave robustly due to the choice of design, namely to limit the circuit to only two logic states"; at other points,
            there were discussions about increasing the (?"state dimensionality"?) to ternary, and circuits have been made using ternary arithmetic logic, but (apparently)
            it's actually harder to design and takes more space (?) [I wouldn't take this to be correct; but, I would consider that indeed implementation complexity needs
            to be considered for optimization; besides, what about using a "hybrid dimensionality" system, where some parts are implemented in binary (if they are more
            efficienctly implemented as such), others in ternary or in octal or in 21-ary etc.]
