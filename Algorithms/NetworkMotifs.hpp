    (*?) "propagation patterns" and the "effect" -> a corresponding ~ "control function"; such functions are then composable,
        and can form the basis for implementing a certain kind of circuitry (for example, the basis of binary digital circuits
        are, to some extent, the boolean functions); but note, at any point in time, the circuitry could integrate some new
        functions which are not obtainable (solely) from the basis functions of propagation (or at least not like in boolean algebra
        where all that is considered are the binary functions, and the rest is all derived from them; or not ?)
