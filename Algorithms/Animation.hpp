    mesh interpolation <e.g.> 3Blue1Brown's animated mascots, whenever they have a transition animation,
        // could it be emulated by a ~ linear interpolation between two meshes (?)
    there was a good game / dev -conf focused on animations and interpolation between ~ "postures", which also
        // discussed the interpolation space and moving between multiple postures simultaneously (?!)
    gradual "gridding" of a rectangle area (or, maybe, a more general space with a metric which defines the
        // "differential unit of space", so that even a curved surface can be gridded ?!)
