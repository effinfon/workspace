/*
    between a set of ordered meshes (homotopic meshes), utilize any ~ "segmentation function" of the path between
        the corresponding vertices [<e.g.> linear segmentation -> interpolation, quadratic, cubic, exponential, etc.],
        to produce a ~ "mesh interpolation"
    devise a sort of "gradual-amplitude function" for producing movement amplitude -> as an example, for key-strokes
        with very short duration the amplitude could be small and then have some growth rate according to a function's slope;
        this function could also be parametrizable; it could even be used to addjust itself to the user's play style, but that
        is another discussion as to how to decide how to adapt to the player's style (*?)
