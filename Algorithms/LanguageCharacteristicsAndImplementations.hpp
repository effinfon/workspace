    constructors are an "unbounded ammount of code" (consider this in the context of their purpose: to initialize some memory allocated to an
        object / to which an object is allocated or assigned ?)
    comparing the (possible) duration of the constructor of a type, to the time it takes to go throug the whole process of requesting some memory from the kernel,
        and then consider it in the context of program specification, filter-searching a codebase (*!?)[one could search a codebase by the duration of functions, so one would
        identify the most time-consuming functions]
