        // consider: one can read and imagine [imagining is sort of like "generating" model data actually (*?), constructing it
            from (contextual / biases) constraints and available data] what some animal looks like or behaves like; one could imagine
            how an animal looks based on its weight, because one might have knowledge of mechanical engineering as to how joints work
            and what anatomy would be optimal (or at least possible) for that weight
        // (*?) "imagination" is central, and is the part of the AI where integration of data from all available models can be composed
            to make deductions about things which are not obtained strictly by way of "training"
        // (*?) => training (~ phase 1), imagintaion (~ phase 2)

    (*!?) "imagination" is a most relevant mechanism for ~ "self-training, by way of (global, available knowledge) integration"; it is a mechanism that
        "crosses the borders of individual disciplines / specifications / search-spaces, and can produce whole new integrative disciplines, or make decisions
        in already existing disciplines"
            <e.g.> I do not necessarely have to see how a debugger works and learn by using one; I can just try to implement one myself and would find which
            are the problems that have to be solved, without even having to lay my eyes or hands on a debugger (*?); there are details about this though which
            are not easily solved, and namely ~ "cues" / "ideas" / "inspiration"; these tend to be a differentiating factor between searchers, actually (*!?)
