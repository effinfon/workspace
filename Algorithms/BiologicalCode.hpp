/*
    (*?!) how did the mitochondria and human genomes have a "codebase simplification / reduction / refactorization"
        in the sense that the genome of the mitochondria has reduced from its former state; besides that, this likely
        has had effects on the human genome as well, in similar fashion; on the other hand, it seems like some sort of
        "specialized modularity", where functions that would otherwise have required the human genome to produce an
        organelle for, and still centralize its code in the nucleus, has instead been moved to a separate container
        in the cytoplasm, the mitochondrion, which as such is also capable of autonomous self-replication, yet still
        under some control from the nucleus (possibly through "signals" ~ operating systems, and sensed through "sensors")
    // (*?) this suggests that meeting with the mithocondrion symbiont has changed the path that our eukaryotic lineage would
        have otherwise followed (?)
