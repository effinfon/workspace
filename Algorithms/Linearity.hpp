/*
    solution space of a "dot-product equation" <e.g.> AX = b    [upper case are vectors, lower case are scalars]
    determine the "compatibility" of the $lhs (whether they create a null solution space or a non-null / non-void solution space)
    lattice intersection problems of the solution space (with the N, with the Z, with the Q, with the R, etc.; except R is a continuum instead ?!)
    it would seem that  the "eigen" starts appearing already (?), as "directions" along which solutions lie in
        <e.g.> eq.: 3x + 4y - 2z = 12 => (2, 0, -3) is a solution, but so are (0, 3, 0) and (3, 1, 5) => find the minimal set of "non-colinearities"
        // that will cover the whole (range of the) solution space; the vectors obtained can be an "eigen basis (of vectors)" describing the (possibly)
        // nDim solution space
